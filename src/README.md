# A ChatGPT bot to respond to your GitHub Issues from https://github.com/flows-network/chatgpt-github-app

[Deploy this function on flows.network](#deploy-chatgpt-github-app-on-your-github-repo) and you will get a GitHub bot that uses ChatGPT to automatically respond to every comment in your GitHub issues. It enables developers to use GitHub Issues as the conversational UI for ChatGPT!

See a live demo [here](https://github.com/second-state/chat-with-chatgpt/)

Powered by `gpt-3.5-turbo`, Rust and [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge)

## Prerequisite 

You will need an [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). If you do not already have one, [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

## Deploy ChatGPT GitHub App on your GitHub repo

To install the ChatGPT GitHub App, we will be using [flows.network](https://flows.network/), a serverless platform that makes deploying your own app quick and easy in just three steps.

### Customize your code

Fork [this repo](https://github.com/flows-network/chatgpt-github-app/) and customize the code as the instructions given below.

> If you do not have an OpenAI API key name, just enter any name here. You will be asked to name your API key later when you connect OpenAI to this function.

### Deploy the code on flow.network

1. Sign up an account for deploying flows on [flows.network](https://flows.network/). It's free.
2. Click on the "Get Started" button and go to a new page "My flows".
3. Click on the "Create a Flow" button to start deploying the ChatGPT GitHub APP
4. Authenticate the [flows.network](https://flows.network/) to access the `chatgpt-github-app` repo you just forked and customized. Once done, click on the "Next" button.

### Configure SaaS integrations

Go to the "My flows" page again and click on the flow we just created. In the Flow details tab, we can set up SaaS integrations required by the flow.

1. Click on the "Connect" button to authenticate your OpenAI account. You'll be redirected to a new page where you could copy and paste your OpenAI API key and then name the key. Note that the name you enter here should be the same as the name in the flow function source code.

2. Click on the "Connect" button to authenticate your GitHub accountout. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to install the `flows-network-integration` bot on a repo. This repo is the one you entered into the flow function source code above.

That's all. As soon as the flow function's status becomes `ready`, the ChatGPT GitHub App goes live. Go ahead and chat with ChatGPT by creating an issue!

> [flows.network](https://flows.network/) is still in its early stages. We would love to hear about your feedback!
